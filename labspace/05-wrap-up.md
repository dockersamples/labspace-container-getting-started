# You Did It! 🎉

You've completed the **Docker Getting Started** lab. Here's everything you accomplished:

- ✅ Verified your Docker environment with `docker version`
- ✅ Ran your first container with `docker run hello-world`
- ✅ Started a real web server (nginx) in a background container
- ✅ Inspected a container's filesystem and logs with `docker exec` and `docker logs`
- ✅ Wrote a `Dockerfile` to describe how to package an application
- ✅ Built a custom image from a Node.js app with `docker build`
- ✅ Ran your own container, saw it in the browser, and experienced container immutability

## Key Concepts to Remember

| Concept | What you learned |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Image** | An immutable blueprint for a container (built from a Dockerfile) |
| **Container** | A running instance of an image with its own isolated process and filesystem |
| **Dockerfile** | A recipe of instructions Docker follows to build an image |
| **`docker run`** | Creates and starts a container from an image |
| **`docker build`** | Builds an image from a Dockerfile |
| **Port mapping** | `-p HOST:CONTAINER` routes traffic from the host into a container |
| **Layer caching** | Copy `package*.json` before app code to avoid re-running `npm install` on every build |
| **Container immutability** | Running containers don't reflect source file changes — rebuild the image to update |

## What's Next?

You've got the foundations. Here's where to go from here:

- **Docker Compose** — Define multi-container applications (app + database + cache) with a single `compose.yaml` file and manage them all with one command
- **Volumes** — Persist data beyond the container lifecycle; mount host directories into containers for development workflows
- **Networking** — Connect containers to each other securely using Docker's built-in networking
- **Multi-stage builds** — Use one stage to compile/build and a second minimal stage for production, dramatically reducing image size
- **Docker Scout** — Scan your images for known vulnerabilities and get remediation advice

> [!TIP]
> The [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com) covers all of these topics with hands-on guides. The [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) has thousands of official images to explore — postgres, redis, mysql, python, go, and more.

🐳 Happy containerizing!
